1. add a padding and depadding function that is fully invertible (gona lose a few bits here 3 to 8) 
2. add a track to the compressed file length 
3. better documentation  

bugs: 
1. copy bytes is goffy gives wrong outputs.
2. append bits returns weird values
2. for some reason pop dosent free when it should?
